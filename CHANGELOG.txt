Changelog DOpE
==============
===============================================================================
25.01.2016: Release of DOpElib 3.0
===============================================================================
03.12.2015: Updated checkwarn.sh to be useful with the deal 8.3.0
	    since the old make-scripts no longer work with the 
	    new cmake system.
03.12.2015: New Example dG-Discretization in a non-stationary setting
	    for the isothermal Euler equations
	    PDE/InstatPDE/Example7
	    Bugfix in integrator needed to allow dG in space 
	    discretizations in time-dependent problems.
02.12.2015: Added support for dG-Discretizations (integration on faces
	    coupling elements) - and corresponding 
	    example PDE/StatPDE/Example13
02.12.2015: Updated Documentation: Removed TeX warnings. Added Thanks to 
	    Christian Goll for his work in the last six years.
19.11.2015: Updated Website - moved website to TU Darmstadt
05.10.2015: Adjusted DOpE to compile with deal.ii 8.3.0
16.01.2015: Added CMake build system for the examples and updated
	    the documentation. Set Version to 3.0 pre.
13.01.2015: Added CMake build system to the library
02.01.2015: Moved the repository to a new home https://svn.dopelib.net
02.01.2015: Fixed a bug, that the norm of the residual in the 
	    ReducedNewtonAlgorithm can get negative due to
	    cancellation errors, aborting the calculation.
	    Now, the calculation is only aborted if the negative 
	    value is too large compared to the requested tolerance;
	    otherwise the iteration is stopped, since the tolerances 
	    are met.
19.12.2014: Fixed Make.global_options in the Examples directory.
	    Now, the linker options are no longer passed to the 
	    creation of the object files but only to linking.
	    This removes spurious Warnings that linking is not done.
19.12.2014: Added support for nonstationary optimization problems with 
	    nonlinear time-derivatives, when access to the state 
	    variable in adjacent timepoints 
	    is needed. These values are accessible unless the problem-type is 
	    "state" via the label "state_i-1" and "state_i+1". 
	    If the problem-type is "state", 
	    "state_i-1" is "last_time_solution" as it always has been and 
	    access to state_i+1 is not possible: 
	        - Don't take future values of the state.  
19.12.2014: The SetTime function in the *Vector classes has been removed 
	    - now SetTimeDoFNumber has to be used. 
	    The functionality of SetTime to interpolate between these values 
	    should not be part of the Vector, but needs to be calculated 
	    outside analog to the nodal-vector and the FEValues object.
===============================================================================
24.10.2014: Release of DOpElib 2.0
===============================================================================
24.10.2014: Add doxygen documentation to website 
24.10.2014: Change private data member notation to trailing underscore 
18.10.2014: Changelog now completely in english
18.10.2014: Executables for the examples are now, by default, 
	    placed in the respective example directory and no longer in a 
	    global bin directory
30.07.2014: Bugfixes for: clang and ubuntu 14.04 
26.02.2014: Support for the ControlVectorBehavior::nostationary has been added
	    to allow controls that vary in time. Added Examples/OPT/InstatPDE/Example3.
26.02.2014: Fixed Bug in nonstationary problems. Up to now, the type timelocal 
	    and timedistributed where not correctly checked for, and it has always been
	    considered to be timelocal. This is now fixed.
28.01.2014: Fixed missing initializations in InstatOptProblemContainer::ReInit.
	    Added temporal refinement (global) to the SpaceTimeHandlers.
	    Added Examples/OPT/InstatPDE/Example2 to demonstrate the 
	    ControlType::stationary.
27.01.2014: Moved the timestepsize from the timestepping scheme into the problem,
	    i.e., the scheme has to be written for stepsize one. This allows 
	    to handle timedependent pdes with time indepenent functionals automatically
	    by scaling only the appropriate terms with the stepsize.
	    Additionally, the FunctionalInterface::NeedTime has now the default
	    return value true to avoid the implementation of this function in stationary 
	    problems.	    
	    Third, the ControlType is now a DOpEtype and no longer a std::string.
02.01.2014: Added the StateVector behavior only_recent where only the 
	    spatial vector of the current timestep exist in memory. 
	    An example is included in PDE/InstatPDE/Example2
29.12.2013: Added DOpEType::VectorStorageType for the vector behavior in 
	    the *Vectors replacing the std::string.
===============================================================================
17.12.2013: Release of DOpElib 1.0
===============================================================================
13.12.2013: 1) description.tex has been rewritten
	    2) contents.tex especially OPT examples
	       and PDE/Instat/Example2 have been updated
	       In particular, explained how optimization problems are 
	       solved using DOpE (_U _UT _UTT Terme, constraints, etc)
	       OPT/StatPDE/Example1 content.tex is now very detailed
            3) PDE/Instat/Example2 extended to FSI with biharmonic mesh
	       motion.
13.12.2013 Code Cleaning in the examples:
		Unified look of the code, deleted unnecessary includes, give
		localpde instead of PDEInterface as template etc., typedefs instead
		of defines for the abbreviations
09.12.2013 Renamed Functions: 
	   FunctionalInterface::Value*
		now is FunctionalInterface:ElementValue*/ 
	   All functions named *cell* are now called 
	   *element*.
06.12.2013 Doxygen documentation finished:
	   Except for self explanatory functions all other
	   should have a doxygen comment.
05.12.2013 Unused parameters should now all be placed in a comment.	
	   All occurences of the __attribute__((unused)) directive 
	   have been removed.
11.09.2013: 1) PDE and OPT StatPDE code cleaned
	    2) Updated doxygen docu
	    3) Experimental Example to develop use of MG-Solver
	    4) Documentation in PDE/StatPDE
09.05.2013: DESCRIPTION: Template - parameters reworked:
	    Changes to the user interface:
	    1) template<typename [FE|DOFHANDLER]> is now template<template<int,int> class [FE|DOFHANDLER]. 
               So instead of, f.i., dealii::DoFHandler<2> you have to specify dealii::DoFHandler as a 
               template parameter.
	    2) ReducedProblemInterface has lost both dim-template-parameters, and derived classes are adapted.
	    3) Most opt-algorithms have lost one or two dim-template-parameters
	    4) PDEInterface has lost dopedim as templateparameter.
08.05.2013: Added interface to IPOPT. 
11.04.2013: DOpElib is running with deal.II 8.0pre, updated
	    deprecated headers
10.04.2013: Added support to estimate the error in the CostFunctional for 
	    Optimization problems added. See OPT/StatPDE/Example1
07.02.2013: Changed Interface of RefineSpace of the MOL-SpaceTimeHandlers
21.12.2012: Removed the now unnecessary deal_II_dim > 1 checks for boundary and face integrals.
	    Now also in 1d we can use boundary equation ...
05.10.2012: Output handler now checks for nan and -nan values to assert that only nan is written in any case.
22.08.2012: OptProblemContainer and PDEProblemContainer now only evaluate Functionals
	    appearing in *Rhs if the type is required by the functional
12.07.2012: -Time stepping schemes rescaled. They now correspond to the scaling one 
	    	  would get using Galerkin-Methods in time.
	    -Removed Default setting in *Time*Explicit methods of the PDEINTERFACE.
	     Now, if not desired they do nothing (and neednot be implemented).
	     In any other case user needs to write *Time*Explicit and write *Time* to 
	     do nothing.
Jun 2012  : Logo and Website have been created
09.05.2012: Backward-Time Loop is running

2. DOpE Meeting 3.5.2012-5.5.2012:
==================================
- Time stepping shemes rechecked for typos.
- Renamed optproblem.h to optproblemcontainer.h (OptProblem to OptProblemContainer)
- Initial Value Computation now done by DOpE, nolonger the fixed dealii function project.
- Changed interface for incorporation of user defined dofconstraints: Dope computes always
   the hanging node constraints (for state and control), after that, the user specified dofconstraints
   (for state and control!) are added.
- DOpEWrapper::FiniteElement removed, use dealii::FESystem instead.
- Removed unnecessary template parameters SPARSITYMAKER and CONSTRAINTSMAKER.
- Removed common code from the timestepping schemes and moved it into the base classes ts_base and primal_ts_base. Moved the files containing the timestepping classes into the directory tsschemes
- Update the Apply...BoundaryValues to include other constraints, 
  like periodicity... (maybe with nonzero jump...). Also check the 
  condense(u)/distribute(u) stuff again, it should not be in the apply 
  boundary value stuff...	
- pdeinterface.h - scale_ico auch fuer CellEquation_u etc. implementieren!
- It is now possible to use pointfunctionals as cost functionals. OPT/StatPDE/Example2 showes this. 

before 2.5.2012
-------------------------
