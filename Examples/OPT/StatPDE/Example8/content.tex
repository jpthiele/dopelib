This example implements the topology optimization of an MBB-Beam given in \\
{\tt OPT/StatPDE/Example6} using the SIMP method.

The solution is computed using the commercial optimization library SNOPT as in 
{\tt OPT/StatPDE/Example7}. This Example demonstrate how global constraints on
the control variable can be included into the optimization call.
