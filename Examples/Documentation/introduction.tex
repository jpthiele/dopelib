\section{Software requirements}

\subsection{deal.ii}
This library is based upon {\tt deal.ii} hence in order to run 
{\tt DOpElib} you need a running copy of {\tt deal.ii}.

The deal.II library is open source and is freely availiable for noncommercial project.
It can be downloaded from \url{http://www.dealii.org/}. On this
homepage, one also finds lots of further information on deal.II as well as
an extensive tutorial where many features of deal.II are discussed in a
well-documented example framework. In order to use DOpE, it is highly
recommendable to be roughly acquainted with deal.II.

\subsection{SNOPT}
If you would like to use the features offered in our SNOPT wrapper. You will 
need to obtain a licence for {\tt SNOPT} 
\url{http://www.sbsi-sol-optimize.com/asp/sol_product_snopt.htm}.
Unfortuately this is at present not availiable for free, but you should check if 
there is a department license already availiable.
