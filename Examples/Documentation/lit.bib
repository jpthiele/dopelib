abstract = "Abstract In this paper, we consider phase-field based fracture propagation in elastic media. The main purpose is the development of a robust and efficient numerical scheme. To enforce crack irreversibility as a constraint, we use a primal-dual active set strategy, which can be identified as a semi-smooth Newton method. The active set iteration is merged with the Newton iteration for solving the fully-coupled nonlinear partial differential equation discretized using finite elements, resulting in a single, rapidly converging nonlinear scheme. It is well known that phase-field models require fine meshes to accurately capture the propagation dynamics of the crack. Because traditional estimators based on adaptive mesh refinement schemes are not appropriate, we develop a predictor-corrector scheme for local mesh adaptivity to reduce the computational cost. This method is both robust and efficient and allows us to treat temporal and spatial refinements and to study the influence of model regularization parameters. Finally, our proposed approach is substantiated with different numerical tests for crack propagation in elastic media and pressurized fracture propagation in homogeneous and heterogeneous media. "
